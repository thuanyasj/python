# Desafio 3 - Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:
#             The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
#             The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
#             The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# Answer:

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
sum_a = a + b
dif_a = a - b 
mult_a = a*b 
print (sum_a)
print (dif_a)
print (mult_a)

# Python: Division - python - introduction
# Read two integers and print two lines. The first line should contain integer division,  a/b.
#The second line should contain float division,  a/b .
#You don't need to perform any rounding or formatting operations.
# Answer:

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
float 
int_a = a//b
parc_a = a/b
print(int_a)
print(parc_a)

# Loops 
# Task 
# Read an integer N. For all non-negative integers i<N, print i**2. See the sample for details.
# Input Format
# The first and only line contains the integer, N .
# Constraints  1<=N<=20
# Output Format
# Print  lines, one corresponding to each .

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())

i = 0
while i < n: 
    print (i**2)
    i +=1 # This is the same as i = i + 1
    if i > 20:
        break
