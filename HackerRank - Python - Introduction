# Desafio 3 - Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:
#             The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
#             The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
#             The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# Answer:

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
sum_a = a + b
dif_a = a - b 
mult_a = a*b 
print (sum_a)
print (dif_a)
print (mult_a)

# Python: Division - python - introduction
# Read two integers and print two lines. The first line should contain integer division,  a/b.
#The second line should contain float division,  a/b .
#You don't need to perform any rounding or formatting operations.
# Answer:

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
float 
int_a = a//b
parc_a = a/b
print(int_a)
print(parc_a)
